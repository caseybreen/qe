<p>Adler, Nancy E., and David H. Rehkopf. 2008. “U.S. Disparities in Health: Descriptions, Causes, and Mechanisms.” Annual Review of Public Health.</p>
<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating health disparities in a fundamental goal of public health research and practice.</li>
<li>Studying health disparities is challenging due the (i) definition of a disparity and (ii) ability to attribute cause from association.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive literature review of both descriptive + causal methods for identifying substantice applications and Annual Review Article — summarizes key studies related to health disparities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What are the key research has been conducted on the causes and mechanisms of health disparities in the US, and how is this research conducted?</li>
<li>What are the causes of health disparities in the US and why what are the specific pathways and mechanisms driving these disparities?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A health disparity is a broad term loosely defined. The broadest definition refers to health differences that occur with respect to gender, race or ethnicity, education, income, geographic location, or sexual orientation. Health disparities result from both biological differences and social disparities, but the latter has a greater effect and in avoidable.</li>
<li>Data limitations often preclude the study of SES and health—particularly the intersection of SES and Race/Ethnicity. Further, SES indicators may have different meanings for different groups (e.g., Blacks and Hispanics have lower wealth than non-Hispanic Whites and Asians at a given income level), further complicating “controlling” for a covariate.</li>
<li>Descriptive understandings are important for (i) understanding short and long-term trends in mortality disparities, (ii) sparking causal investigations of health disparities, (iii) allocating resources to reduce disparities in specific diseases, and (iv) increasing public awareness.</li>
<li>Analytic approaches for establishing causality include propensity score matching, instrumental variables, time-series analysis, causal structural equation modeling, and marginal structural models.<br />
</li>
<li>Identifying the specific pathways and mechanisms by which SES and race/ethnicity affect health can strengthen causal claims and help target health interventions. For example, differential exposure to stress, particularly repeated exposure, is one of multiple pathways identified in the literature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unanswered Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How do we collect data with adequate measures of SES, demographic covariates, and health outcomes to identify understand the mechanisms and pathways?</li>

<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The core objective of social science research is to understand the (ubiquitous) population heterogeneity. (Not identify abstract and universal laws).</li>
<li>Causal inference with observational data is only possible with strong assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptualize selection into treatment as a dynamic process.</li>
<li>Composition bias is generated by a dynamic process when the treatment proportion changes. Demonstrated via simulation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the relationship between population heterogeneity and causal inference? How can composition bias arise from population heterogeneity?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is impossible to draw causal inference at the individual level due to heterogeneity.</li>
<li>Composition bias, a form of selection bias, arises often in the real world. For example, if the administration of a medical treatment or social intervention is done on a graduated schedule, where participation is need based. Individuals selected ata later states will have lower ATEs because they are coming from a less responsive sub-population.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Composition bias occurs because units with a higher intrinsic propensity of treatment are more likely to be over-represented when the treatment proportion is small.</li>
<li>Researchers should be mindful of the specific subgroups of interest when deriving and interpreting average causal estimates from potentially heterogeneous subgroups.</li>

<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the role of causal inference in sociological research?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional setup in sociology papers is insufficient—comparing regression specifications and testing competing hypotheses is unlikely to identify any causal effect of interest.</li>
<li>While the benefits of RCTs are widely understood, regression using observational data is the workhorse of sociology research. Lit review provides a sobering view of the efficacy of drawing causal conclusions from regression analysis, as practiced in sociology.</li>
<li>Counterfactual framework doesn’t only apply to explicitly manipulable treatments—it can also apply to non-manipulable factors such as gender, race, or class.</li>
<li>Standard treatment of effect estimates are local — historically and situationally contingent.</li>

<h3>Petersen, Maya L., Sandra E. Sinisi, and Mark J. van der Laan. 2006.</h3>
<p><strong>Citation</strong></p>
<p>Petersen, Maya L., Sandra E. Sinisi, and Mark J. van der Laan. 2006. “Estimation of Direct Causal Effects.” Epidemiology 17(3):276–84.</p>
<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most common problems in epidemiology (and social science more broadly) involve estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome while blocking the exposure’s effect on an intermediate variable. Estimation of direct effects is typically the goal of research attempting to estimate the causal pathways for which a treatment causes an outcome.</li>
<li>Controlled direct Effect: hold intermediate variable at a fixed level. In contrast, a natural direct effect would measure the effect of the exposure, blocking the exposure’s effect on intermediate background but allowing the intermediate to vary among individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<p>What’s the difference between a controlled and a natural direct effect and how can the natural direct effect be estimated (and with which underlying assumptions)?</p>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Natural direct effect of an exposure on an individual is defined as the difference in counterfactual outcome if an individual was unexposed vs. exposed allowing the intermediate to remain at counterfactual level under no exposure. For a controlled direct effect, the intermediate would be set to a fixed value for all persons.</li>
<li>To estimate the direct effect in the whole population, one can take the weighted average of subgroup-specific direct effects with the weight fort a given subgroup determined by the relative size of the subgroup in comparison with the population.</li>
<li>Formal assumptions for estimating controlled and natural effects</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
A \perp Y_{AZ} | W \\ 
Z \perp Y_{AZ} | A, W
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>In words, this means no unmeasured confounders of either the effect of the exposure on the outcome of the effect of the intermediate on the outcome.</p>
<p>Additionally, to identify natural direct effects, we need:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
A \perp Z_a | W \\ 
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>which in words says there are no unmeasured confounders of the effect of the intermediate on the treatment.</p>
<p>Second, within subgroups defined by covariates, the level of the intermediate variable in the absense of exposure does not tell us anything about the expected magnitude of exposure’s effect at a controlled level of the intermediate variable. (Direct effect assumption)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
E(Y_{az} - Y_{0z} | Z_0 = z, W) = E(Y_{az} - Y_{0z} | W)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The barriers to estimation of direct effects are not as great as have been previously suggested. Researchers are encouraged to estimate direct effects which giving appropriate consideration to relevant assumptions and interpretations of their estimates.</li>

<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many empirical studies focus on establishing whether on variable affects another and fails to explain how such a causal relationship arises. This “black box” approach to causality has been criticized across disciplines.</li>
<li>A causal mechanism is a process in which a causal variable of interest influences an outcome.</li>
<li>Quantitative investigation of causal mechanisms is based on the estimation of causal mediation effects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review of causal inference literature, particularly as it applies to the estimation of causal mediation effects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong><br />
- What methods and assumptions can researchers use to identify the causal mechanisms behind observed causal effects?</p>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency assumption—potential outcomes must take the same values as long as the treatment and mediator values are the same—is especially important in the analysis of causal mechanisms. Even if experimental designs involve the manipulation of mediators, one must assume that subjects would respond in the same way if those values of mediators were spontaneously chosen by the subjects themselves.</li>
<li>Instrumental variables: assume that there is no direct effect on the outcome and effects all units in one direction. However, this often leads to the “black box” approach to causal inference, where insufficient attenuation is paid to causal mechanisms.<br />
</li>
<li>Given the difficult of studying causal mechanisms, some researchers believe that a focus should be place on identifiation of causal effects and not causal mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Finding / Conclusion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paper demonstrates three ways to move forward in research into causal mechanisms. First, the potential outcomes model of causal inference. Second, a sensitivity analysis to evaluate robustness of conclusions. Finally, new research designs for experimental and observational studies can reduce need for untestable conclusions. These new methods allow the black box of causality to be unpacked, going beyond the estimation of causal effects.</li>

<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Concepts of cause and causal inference are largely self-taught from early learning experiences.</li>
<li>Causal inference in epidemiology is more an exercise in measurement of an effect rather than a criterion-guided process for deciding whether an effect is present of not.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Literature review</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How should we think about causation and causal inference in epidemiology?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Analogy: turning a light switch “on” will lead to light going on. However, the complete causal mechanism is much more intricate (e.g., bulb, wiring, electricity). Such basic models cannot serve as the basis for scientific theory, and a better starting place is a general conceptual model.</li>
<li>A given disease, for example, can be caused by more than one causal mechanism (multicausality). Thus, falling on an icy oath leading to a broken hip may be just part of a complicated causal mechanism that involves many component causes. Takeaway: most identified causes are neither necessary nor sufficient to produce disease.</li>
<li>All scientific work are only tentative formulations of a description of nature, even when work is carried out without error.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While all studies will have error, the key is to quantify the errors. There are no qbsolutet criteria for assessing the validity of scientific evidence, it is will possible to assess the validity of a study, although this requires familiarity with the study and subject matter.</li>

<li>This paper introduces an alternative theory, the negative selection hypothesis: those who are most least likely to attend college are the most likely to benefit. Given the family and individual attributes are associated with the attainment of higher education, mechanisms influencing college attainment may differ by social background. For example, there is much heterogeneity in the financial burden and the family pressure of deviating from cultural norms based on one’s socioeconomic background.</li>
<li>There are two types of selection bias in observational data. First, heterogeneity in preexisting conditions or attributes associated with both the treatment condition and the outcome. Second, heterogeneity in treatment effects, i.e. systematic differences between those who do and do not attain a college education in the causal effect of a college education on earnings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How can we adjudicate between the positive and negative selection hypothesis using causal propensity-score matching methods?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Three step approach: (1) Invoke randomization assumption and assume no additional confounders between persons who do and do not complete college (2) Summarize differences in covariates between college and non-college goes using estimated propensity score matching. (3) Revisit the ignorability assumption using auxiliary analyses that aid the interpretation of results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ignorability assumption: potential outcomes are uncorrelated with treatment status, conditional on observed covariates. Can never be verified and should not be taken as true in practice for observational data.</li>
<li>As only one outcome is actually observed, causal inference is impossible at the individual level and always requires analysis at the group level on the basis of some homogeneity assumption.</li>
<li>We can’t condition on all covariates </li>
<li>Comparing slopes of propensity score stratum and treatment effect of college completion on earnings of the life course shows support for negative selection hypothesis at each observed stage of the life course.</li>
<li>When models were restricted to a more limited set of covariates, there was evidence for positive selection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals from the most disadvantaged social origins and the lowest ability and achievement, actually completed college, they benefited the most in terms of labor market outcomes.</li>
<li>Heterogeneity in response to a treatment in a norm rather than an exception</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unanswered Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How does the amount, quality, major, etc. of education influence labor market outcomes?</li>
<li>More selectivity for those <em>less</em> likely to attend college?</li>

<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The causal effect of income on psychological well-being has been well studied across the social sciences, but reverse causality is arguably understudied.</li>
<li>Positive correlation between “cheerfulness” measured in a sample of elite college students and their income levels 19 y later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the relationship between income and happiness? What is the causal direction and what are the mediating pathways between income and happiness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individual fixed effects and sibling fixed effects regression models controlling for self-esteem and life satisfaction using data from Add health.<br />
</li>
<li>Sobel-Goodmand method for mediation analysis: (i) X significantly predicts M, (ii) X significantly predicts Y in the absence of M, (iii) M significantly predicts Y controlling for X, and (iv) the effect of X on Y shrinks upon addition of M.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most significant mediating pathways include obtaining a college degree getting hired and promoted, higher degrees of optimism and extroversion, and less neuroticism. These results provide support for the causal mechanisms running from subjective well-being to later income.</li>
<li>Adding sibling fixed effects allows for making inferences about lagged effect of well-being at a particular time points instead of having to consider variation between time intervals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This paper reverses one of the most famous questions of social science, exploring the influence of income upon well-being.</li>
<li>Regression equations of happiness on income will produce unreliable results unless the endogeneity of income is incorporated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unanswered Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How do we consistently measure “happiness” or “well-being” — this paper seems like it may not reproduce in other contexts because self-reported happiness is highly contextual. Strong interviewer effects, strong seasonal effects, etc.</li>

<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite extensive discussion of assimilation, surprisingly little empirical research examines the consequences of cultural assimilation for economic achievement, in part because (i) culture is difficult to measure and (ii) it is difficult to disentangle measure of cultural assimilation from those of socioeconomic success.</li>
<li>Names are largely constant over a lifetime, so controlling for socioeconomic gradients in name-giving allows for causal identification of cultural assimilation indicated by the identity aspect of a name.</li>
<li>Names are important symbols of group affiliation, connoting class and ethnicity. Further, “Black”-sounding names are associated with discrimination in the labor market, as demonstrated by audit studies.</li>
<li>Names are a proxy measure of a broader set of intentions, cultural markers used by parents to express their own desires and traditions.</li>
<li>A name is distinctive if it is disproportionately held by members of a particular group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are immigrants who assimilated better—as measured by how “American” sounding their name is—able to more effectively climb the economic ladder in the US?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Construct a score of the ethnic distinctiveness of names based on relative frequency of each name:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
ENI(name_j, ethnicity_k) = \frac{p (name_j | ethnicity_k)}{p(name_j | ethnicity_k) + p(name_j | native)}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where p is the fraction holding given names among <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> people in ethnicity <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regression of Ethnic Name Index (ENI) on occupational prestige score with vector of controls including age, urban/rural residence, region of residence, and nativity of mother. Second regression with controls for the correlation between name-giving and class background + occupational prestige score of fathers by name of son for father-son pairs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<p>— For most groups, cultural assimilation as measured by first names is strongly positively correlated with occupational achievement. Russian, predominantly Jewish, immigrants are an exception.
- Historical datasets with names can be useful for related research topics + interests, including (1) historical effects of distinctively black names, (2) ethnic names on marriage and ethnic intermarriage, (3) the effect of religion on fertility, using biblical names as proxy.
- Methods are well-sited for applications to contemporary immigration and naming; further, only requires frequency of names not entire spelling itself (coded numeric string can be used as proxies for distinct names).</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It it possible to translate names into quantitative indicies of cultural assimilation for children of immigrants, and this information can be easily incorporated into models of occupational attainment.</li>
<li>Controlling for social class gradient allows for a more causal interpretation, where parents who are able to and chose to make their children “more American” confer an advantage in terms of occupation achievement.</li>

<p><strong>Citation</strong></p>
<p>Taubman, Sarah L., James M. Robins, Murray A. Mittleman, and Miguel A. Hernán. 2009. “Intervening on Risk Factors for Coronary Heart Disease: An Application of the Parametric g-Formula.” International Journal of Epidemiology 38(6):1599–1611. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyp192.</p>
<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Epidemiologists often want to estimate the effects of hypothetical interventions to inform policy and clinical decisions. While ideally these questions could be answered with large, randomized experiments, in practice we need to infer answers from observational longitudinal studies.
— The g-formula provides a framework to estimate the effects of hypothetical interventions, including joint and dynamic intervention, from complex longitudinal data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the causal effect of different interventions (e.g., avoid smoking, exercise 30 min a day, consuming alcohol) on the 20-year CHD risk?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data from the Nurses’ Health Study (N = 121,701) registered nurses aged 30-55 respondent to a mailed questionnaire.</li>
<li>Employed the parametric g-formula to consistently estimate CHD risk under a hypothetical intervention assuming all joint predictors of the outcome and of the exposures involved in the intervention are measured at all time points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<p>— The G-Formula relies on the same assumptions (no unmeasured confounding, no measurement error, and no model misspecification) as other standard methods, but it correctly adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure.
- The authors assume no loss to follow-up, and intervene to set C_k = 0 for all time points.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<p>— Despite its limitations, the G-Comp Formula is a powerful and useful tool for epidemiologic analysis, and can be used to compare hypothetical interventions from observational cohort studies under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding.
- Hypothetical interventions can be dynamic or static, and can involve multiple exposures.</p>

<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In conducting studies on an exposure of interest, a systematic roadmap should be applied for translating causal questions into statistical analyses and interpreting results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How can we apply the causal roadmap to estimate the joint effect of both time to availability of a nurse-based triage system and individual enrollment in the program among HIV patients in East Africa.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discretice follow-up into 90-day time intervals and target the population mean counterfactual outcome at up to 450 days after initial LREC eligibility under three different treatments.</li>
<li>Implement an application of iterated conditional expectation of the longitudinal g-formula and perform a case study of the targeted learning road map in the longitudinal setting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are a range of estimators have been developed (estimators of the statistical estimand to which the counterfactual effects correspond under the sequential randomization assumption).</li>
<li>Inverse probability weighted (IPTW), Parametric g-computation, and double-robust estimating equation-based estimators — further, iterated conditional expectation g-computation and double-robust substitution estimators.</li>
<li>Causal Roadmap
<ul>
<li>First, frame scientific question as a statistical question that can be answered with observed data</li>
<li>Assume data consists of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> iid observations of random variable <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> with some underlying probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span>. Thus statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> should be chosen to contain the true distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and thus any model assumptions should be based only on real knowledge about process that generated data.</li>
<li>Requires translating scientific question into a formal causal query by static interventions to a set vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> of treatment (or exposure) variables equal to a set value <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define causal model representing additional knowledge and assumptions associated with our scientific question that connot be represented statistically.</li>
<li>Represent causal model <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}^F}\)</span> using the structural equation models to formally present how we assumed each variable to be generated.</li>
<li>Conceptualizing an ideal hypothetical experiment can help define the target counterfactual parameter of interest.</li>
<li>Identifiability with sequential randomization assumption and positivity assumption.</li>
<li>Estimation with the ICE approach, which has several advantages compared to the standard g-computation procedure.</li>
<li>Superlearner with a loss function and a user-specified library to estimate the nuisance parameters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several limitations. First, it is possible that not all potential confounders were adjusted for. Second, in defining our composite outcome explicitly assumed that not being in clinic for 198 days is an undesirable outcome reflecting our of care status. Last, they assume that subjects in the same clinics were causally independent of each other.</li>
<li>In summary, this paper applied the targeted learning roadmap to longitudinal data with multilevel longitudinal treatment of interest to analyze a nurse-based triage system for HIV patients in East Africa, finding a somewhat negligible impact of availability and enrollment in the LREC program on in-case survival.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced a framework that can easily be generalized to include dynamic interventions that are dependent upon other covariates.</li>
<li>Substantively, they found a negligible impact of both availability and enrollment in the LREC program on in-care survival.</li>

<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most scholars conclude that there is a causal link between education and longevity, but recent studies have proposed that education is primarily a proxy for unobserved endowments that promote longevity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does education causally change people’s lives in a way that delays mortality?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The authors use the 1920 full-count census to identify siblings. Next, they link to the 1940 census to obtain key covariates — including a measure of education — and finally, link to the Numident records. In effect, they have created a longitudinal panel.<br />
</li>
<li>Empirical strategy: standard fixed-effects specification for within-pairs estimation of twins and siblings, measuring continuous measures of age at death for individuals in twinships as a factor of years of schooling, unobserved contextual characteristics, such as family, peer group, and unobserved genetic endowments.</li>
<li>Looking at educational discordance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Potential confounders include social or economic background, their intelligence, their early-life health, and any other hard-to-observe endowments or contextual exposures that jointly predict educational attainment and survival.</li>
<li>Findings suggest that the effects of education on mortality are positive in the aggregate.<br />
</li>
<li>There may be significant effect heterogeneity. Perhaps presence of cumulative advantage — resource multiplication hypothesis — means that the biggest returns go to individuals who are the most advantaged.</li>
<li>By running a set of increasingly stringent model specifications, the authors are left with an attenuated but still strong and significant relationship between education and longevity, differencing out features of neighborhood, family, and genetic endowment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a strong and significant positive causal effect of education on longevity, but caution is warranted for both internal validity (within-pair design does not control fo early-life health conditions and illnessses, personality characteristics, or genetic endownments). Further, external validity also of course warrants caution, as it is likely that this relationship varies substantially across time, space, and populations.</li>
<li>Each additional year of schooling causes a 0.347 y increase in longevity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do these same patterns hold across key population subgroups? To what extent is there effect heterogeneity? Who benefits the most from education?</li>
<li>To what extent do these findings generalize to women?</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> The Consistency Assumption for Causal Inference in Social Epidemiology: When a Rose is not a Rose</h3>
<p><strong>Citation</strong></p>
<p>Rehkopf, David H., M. Maria Glymour, and Theresa L. Osypuk. 2016. “The Consistency Assumption for Causal Inference in Social Epidemiology: When a Rose Is Not a Rose.” Current Epidemiology Reports 3(1):63–71.</p>
<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The leap between exposures and measured and exposures as intervene upon is typically supported by the consistency assumption, which entails that exposure is defined with enough specificity that different variants of the exposure do not have different effects on the outcome.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How should social epidemiolgists studies be more explicit in naming and discussing consistency assumptions when describing the exposure of interest? When is the consistency assumption violated and how can such violations be attended to to help design more effective interventions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>General discussion of consistency assumption and three examples (income, education, and neighborhood) where this assumption may be violated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The consistency assumption requires that there are no two “flavors” or versions of treatment such that <span class="math inline">\(X = 1\)</span> under both versions but the potential outcome for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would be different under the alternative versions.</li>
<li>Note this is different that the Bradford Hill Criterion of “consistency” which invokes the view that if most studies find a similar result the association is more likely to be causal than if different studies report different results. (And no consistency statistical estimator, i.e., an estimator that moves closer to the truth in larger sample sizes.)</li>
<li>Should we seek causal explanations only for definable interventions? Maybe. (This is the manipulability criterion.)</li>
<li>For example, if we have composite SES score, and intervening on SES by increasing education has different health consequences than intervening on SES by increasing income, than SES is not a well-defined intervention and violates consistency criterion.</li>
<li>Perhaps the consistency criterion is overlooked because it’s so fundamental to causal inference.</li>
<li>Related but distinct concern is effect measure modification. The effect measure modification occurs when an outcome of interest is different in some subgroups of the population as compared to others (e.g., heart disease differs between men and women).</li>
<li>Finally, exposures that influence an outcome via multiple mediating pathways do not necessarily violate the consistency assumption; however, the do imply potential for violations as possible interventions could trigger some but not all mediating pathways.</li>
<li>In practice: Income and education both may be highly susceptible to consistency violations. For education, aspects of quality such as school term duration, quality, peers, talents, prestige, networks, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial research may appropriately back-burner consistency to evaluate whether one component of a large but ill-defined treatment influences outcome. This is particularly appropriate for new research areas.</li>
<li>Studies should be explicit about the assumptions of their version of treatment or exposure (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) and draw on both theoretical and empirical evidence to identify potential variation in treatment. Further, unless there is strong evidence there is not a consistency violation, researchers should use a limited range of treatments and systemically assess different versions of the specific exposure.</li>
<li>More broadly, violations of the consistency assumption in social science research may give another explanation of heterogenous research results from observational studies.</li>

<p><strong>Key Background</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While confounding bias is a well-recognized source of bias in causal inference effect estimation, relatively little attention has been paid to the assumption of positivity.</li>
<li>Positivity assumption refers to the need for adequate exposure variability within confounder strata as the assumption of positivity or experimental treatment assignment.
- May be theoretically impossible for individuals with certain covariate values to receive a given exposure of interest. (Structural or theoretical violation)
- May be due to chance due to finite sample sizes and large adjustment sets (with continuous or multi-level covariates).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Question</strong></p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>
- Application of parametric bootstrap to (1) simulated data and (2) observational cohort of HIV-infected patients using G-comp, IPTW, and DR TMLE estimators.</p>
<p><strong>Argument / contribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strong Positivity Assumption, which may be relaxed under some assumed parametric models</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\underset{a \in \mathcal{A}}{inf}(a | W) &gt; 0, -a.e.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>IPTW estimators are very sensitive to violations or near-violations of the positivity assumption. Weights can be truncated (introducing bias) or stabilized</li>
<li>Double robust estimators and G-Comp estimators will face some difficulties when positivy doesn’t hold.</li>
<li>To diagnose potential violations of the positivity assumption, we can examine the distribution of estimated propensity scores (very low propensity scores denote near positivity violations). This can be applied for any estimator!</li>
<li>While propensity scores can be used for diagnosis, they don’t give any quantitative estimate of the degree to which such violations are resulting in estimator bias and may pose a threat to inference.</li>
<li>The parametric bootstrap an be applied to further diagnose near positivity violations, but the performance of an estimator therefore depends on the extent to which the observed data distribution approximates the true data generating process. So, the parametric bootstrap will not tell us a good estimate of the true bias — again, it is mostly recommended as a diagnostic tool.</li>
<li>There are a few practical approaches to causal inference in the presence of positivity violations. First, the projection function can be changed on the marginal structural model (MSM). Second, the adjustment set can be restricted. Specifically, the exclusion of a problematic <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> means trading some confounding bias for a reduction in positivity violations. Third, the sample can be restricted, sometimes referred to as ‘trimming’. Specifically, such an approach can be implemented by discarding subjects with covariate values not represented in all treatment groups. Finally, the intervention itself can be changed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define the causal effect of interest based on careful consideration of structural positivity violations. Then consider estimator behavior given positivty violations when selecting an estimator. Quantitatively assess the amount of bias under simulated data to approximate the true data generating distribution and finally select an estimator that systematically selects between data support and proximity to the initial target of inference.</li>
